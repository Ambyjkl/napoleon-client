# napoleon-client
Client for the Napoleon card game.
## Objective
One must collect all the 52 cards of the deck by taking cards from other players.
## Rules
1. The cards are split as equally as possible among all the players.
2. The player with the Ace of Spades goes first.
3. On each turn, a player has to take one card from another player. The player can choose any card whose value is one they already have a card of.
4. The player has to choose a player to take this card from. If this player has this card, they must give them that card to add to their collection. Else, it is the turn of the chosen player.
5. Once a player runs out of cards, they lose.
6. The game goes on the same way until a player has formed groups of four for each of their card values. Now this player can take an entire group of four cards from other players (given they have it). But the catch is that this player gets to see their hand for one last time and must on subsequent turns rely solely on memory to play.
7. The game ends when one player wins by collecting all the cards of the deck.

## Game strats
### The Ace of Spades
Probably the easiest card to guess, as everyone knows who has it: the player who got to go first. If you have the Ace of Spades, then try your best to protect it, although you can't do much about it. But if you don't and you have another Ace, you know where to guess.
### The Card values
Each time you make a guess, you are giving out information to the other players about your hand. They now know that you have a card of that value and you surely* don't have the card you just guessed for, because why would you ask for it in the first place*?
### The 50% protect
Say you have the Seven of spades and you ask the player next to you for the Seven of hearts. They don't have it and it is now their turn. It turns out that they in fact had a seven, albeit it was the Seven of Clubs. Now they know that you have a seven that is not* the Seven of Hearts because of what I just said. They also know that it is not the Seven of Clubs because they have it. This means that they know for sure* that you have either the Seven of Spades or the Seven of Diamonds. So they have a fifty percent chance of guessing the card right to take from you. If they guess the wrong card, that is, the Seven of Diamonds, now you know for sure* that they have the Seven of Clubs and can take it from them. The same logic can be applied from the other end. But it only works 50% of the time, just like the move "Protect" from Pokemon when used twice in a row, which always seems to fails for me, and it is the same case here as well. Hence the reference, hence the name.
### The "know for sure*"
Consider a similar situation, just like the one above. But in this case, the other player has both the Seven of Clubs and the Seven of Diamonds. So now they "know for sure*"
### The Bluff
Just forget about everything I just said for a second and think about why I put in so many *'s. It is because you can bluff! By guessing a certain card that you know your target cannot have on purpose, like a card of your own, you can wait a bit, especially at the beginning of the game to get an idea of what cards the other players have. This kinda tosses the above strategies up in the air, so keep that in mind. Also, don't bluff too much, the other players are likely to get pissed :P. Also, keep in mind that bluffs can go wrong in all sorts of ways, like when say you have the Seven of Spades and the person you are guessing from has all the other three, and you go ahead and bluff a Seven of Spades. They know you are a dirty liar take away your last seven! Hence you should only bluff when you have a good idea of the cards others have, but if you did, why would you bluff in the first place?
